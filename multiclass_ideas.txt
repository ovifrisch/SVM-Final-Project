one vs all:
if there are L classes, then train L classifiers.
Each classifier will do binary classification between one class and the rest of the classes
Assume classes A, B, C
For each classifier, need to modify dataset so that if we are building a classifier for A vs rest, all As will have class = 1, and the rest will have -1
											B vs rest, all Bs will have class = 1, and the rest will have -1
											C vs rest, all Cs will have class = 1, and the rest will have -1


Given a testing example xi, we run it through each of the classifiers.
Say the first classifier is A vs rest (clfA), then if clfA classifies xi as 1, we increment the number of "votes" for A by 1
					           if clfA classifies xi as -1, we increment the number of "votes" for B and C by 1

After running each classifier on xi, we assign xi to the class with the most votes.
